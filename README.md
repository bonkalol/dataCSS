# Development version of dataCSS

## dataCSS

dataCSS is a CSS framework which uses data-* attr to stylize page

	<header data-hero-wrap>
		<div data-hero-content>
			<h1 data-hero-title>dataCSS are awesome</h1>
		</div>
	</header>

I'm tired of looking at bootstrap with 1000 classes for a single tag. Attributes just avoid this problem, in addition to this, you can easily change the value of any property using css classes. It's also give so much flexability!
